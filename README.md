## Requirements

Numpy, pandas, pytorch etc. For our detailed running environment see requirements.txt


## How to run LRURec
The command below specifies the training of LRURec on MovieLens-1M.
```bash
python train.py --dataset_code=ml-1m
```

Excecute the above command (with arguments) to train LRURec, select dataset_code from ml-1m, beauty, video, sports, steam and xlong. XLong must be downloaded separately and put under ./data/xlong for experiments. Once trainin is finished, evaluation is automatically performed with models and results saved in ./experiments.


## Performance

The table below reports our main performance results, with best results marked in bold and second best results underlined. For training and evaluation details, please refer to our paper.
